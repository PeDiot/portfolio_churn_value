# Data {#data}

In this chapter, we introduce the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset) dataset related to customers of a fictional telecommunications service provider (TSP). In this duration dataset, the `Churn_Value` status variable indicates whether the customer left the firm's *portfolio* within the last month while the `Tenure_Months` variable stands for the duration actually observed. Besides customer *value* can be approximated by the `CLTV` variable. 

## General Overview

The data set used in this study contains 29 variables and 7032 customers from a telecom firm. For each client, the data includes: 

- **Demographic** information: `CustomerID`, `City`, `Zip_Code`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, `Gender`, `Senior_Citizen`, `Partner` and `Dependents`.

- **Customer account** information: `Tenure_Months`, `Contract`, `Paperless_Billing`, `Payment_Method`, `Monthly_Charges`, `Total_Charges`, `Churn_Label`, `Churn_Value`, `Churn_Score`, `CLTV`, `Churn_Reason`.

- **Services** information: `Phone_Service`, `Multiple_Lines`, `Internet_Service`, `Online_Security`, `Online_Backup`, `Device_Protection`, `Tech_Support`, `Streaming_TV`, `Streaming_Movies`.


```{r}
data_path <- "./data/telco_cleaned.RData"
load(data_path)
```

```{r dataoverview}
cleaned_data %>%
  select(c(
    "CustomerID", 
    "Monthly_Charges", 
    "Internet_Service", 
    "Tenure_Months", 
    "Churn_Value", 
    "Monthly_Charges"
  )) %>%
  head() %>%
  mykable(title = "Interesting variables for the 5 first customers in the data set")
```

As shown by table \@ref(tab:dataoverview), the `Churn_Value` status variable indicates whether the customer left the firm's *portfolio* within the last month and `Tenure_Months` is the duration variable. 

Since the purpose of our study relies in estimating the overall value of this fictional firm's *portfolio*, two groups of target variables can be considered. On the one hand `Churn_Value` and `Tenure_Months` permit to determine whether a customer is active in the *portfolio*. They are used as response variables in the survival models. On the other hand, `Monthly_Charges` variable indicates the price paid by customers each month and may be used to derive a customer raw value. Even though the `CLTV` variable represents each customer's *value* through measurement of customer lifetime value, we do not have any information on its calculation. Thus, it is not used in the model developed in the next chapter. 

## `Churn_Value` and `Tenure_Months` {#churndescstats}

As the combination of these two features form the response variable in the duration models, a relevant approach to have an overall description of the risk of *attrition* may be to draw the raw survival curves depending on treatment variables. Pearson's $\chi^2$ tests are also performed so as to test the statistical relationships between the churn indicator variable and explanatory features. Pearson's $\chi^2$ test determines whether there is a statistically significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories of a contingency table. It is thus adapted to test whether two categorical variables are statistically independent. In this context, it appears interesting to use explanatory features related  demographic, customer account and services subscribed as treatment variables when fitting the Kaplan-Meier estimator and implementing the tests. 

### Demographic data {-}

Table \@ref(tab:chi2demographics) depicts the $\chi^2$ tests' results performed on demographic variables. Given the *p-values* are ranked in ascending order and given the lower the *p value* the stronger link between two categorical variables, `Dependents` appears to be the most correlated feature with `Churn_Label`. When comparing this result with the corresponding survival plot in figure \@ref(fig:kmdemographics), it can be noted that customers with dependants have a longer lifetime in the *portfolio*. Conversely, `Gender` and `Churn_Label` are statistically independent as stated by the high test's *p value* ($\approx .49$). 

```{r chi2demographics}
demographics <- c("Gender", "Senior_Citizen", "Partner", "Dependents")
chi2_demographics <- lapply(
  demographics, 
  chi_2_test_tab, 
  data = cleaned_data
) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  arrange(as.numeric(`p-value`))
chi2_demographics %>%
  mykable(title = "Independence $\\chi^2$ test between churn and demographic variables")
```

In section \@ref(nonparam), nonparametric estimation has been introduced focusing on two major estimators: Kaplan-Meier for survival function estimation and Nelson-Aalen for estimating the cumulative hazard function. In this part, it is decided to draw survival curves related to customer lifetime in the portfolio depending on different types of treatment variables. In the figure below, four main results can be highlighted *ceteris paribus*: 

- There seems to be no difference in terms of lifetime duration between men and women. 
- Customers with a partner appear to stay longer in the TSP's *portfolio*. 
- Being a senior citizen tends to shorten customer lifetime. 
- As said before, customer with children or other dependents seem to be more loyal. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot_list <- lapply(
  demographics, 
  plot_km,
  surv_data = cleaned_data, 
  risk_table = F
)
demographics_plot <- arrange_ggsurvplots(
  x = plot_list, 
  ncol = 2, nrow = 2,
  print = F
)
ggsave(
  filename = "./imgs/demographics_plot.jpg",
  plot = demographics_plot, 
  height = 8, width = 12
)
```

```{r kmdemographics, fig.cap="Kaplan-Meier survival function depending on demographic information"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./imgs/demographics_plot.jpg")
```

### Data on services subscribed {-}

When dealing with data on customers of a TSP, features related to services subscribed may be relevant to explain the estimated survival of these customers in the *portfolio*. 

Table \@ref(tab:chi2services) presents results of $\chi^2$ tests performed between `Churn_Label` and each services information variable. As in the previous table, *p-values* are ranked in ascending order. One can note that `Online_Security` and `Tech_Support` are the most linked to the churn indicator variable. However, variable carrying information on phone services are less correlated to `Churn_Label`.  

```{r chi2services}
services <- c(
  "Phone_Service",
  "Multiple_Lines",
  "Internet_Service",
  "Online_Security",
  "Online_Backup",
  "Device_Protection", 
  "Tech_Support",
  "Streaming_TV",
  "Streaming_Movies"
)
chi2_services <- lapply(
  services, 
  chi_2_test_tab, 
  data = cleaned_data
) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  arrange(as.numeric(`p-value`))
chi2_services %>%
  mykable(title = "Independence $\\chi^2$ test between churn and services information variables")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot_list <- lapply(
  services, 
  plot_km,
  surv_data = cleaned_data, 
  risk_table = F, 
  font_size = 14
)
services_plot <- arrange_ggsurvplots(
  x = plot_list, 
  ncol = 3, nrow = 3,
  print = F
)
ggsave(
  filename = "./imgs/services_plot.jpg",
  plot = services_plot, 
  height = 12, width = 18
)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:kmservices) illustrates the $\chi^2$ tests' results by representing the Kaplan-Meier estimated survivor function related to customer lifetime according to treatment variables on services subscribed. On the one hand, there seems to be no significant difference in terms of survival whether the customer uses phone service or not. The same remark can be pointed out based on whether the client has multiple lines as `Phone_Service` and `Multiple_Lines` might be quite correlated. In contrast, huge survival time difference can be noticed between customers with online security and those without, as well as between those having subscribed to technical support and those who have not. Finally, not using Internet service appears to have a positive influence on customer lifetime. 
 
```{r kmservices, fig.cap="Kaplan-Meier survival function depending on services subscribed"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./imgs/services_plot.jpg")
```

### Customer account data {-}

Variables on customer account such as the payment method used and the type of contract between the TSP and the client can be rich in information on customer lifetime. Indeed, table \@ref(tab:chi2custaccount) shows that churn status strongly depends on the three variables, `Contract` being the most linked to `Churn_Label`. 

```{r chi2custaccount}
account_info <- c("Payment_Method", "Paperless_Billing", "Contract")
chi2_account_info <- lapply(
  account_info, 
  chi_2_test_tab, 
  data = cleaned_data
) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  arrange(as.numeric(`p-value`))
chi2_account_info %>%
  mykable(title = "Independence $\\chi^2$ test between churn and customer account data")
```

```{r kmaccountinfo, eval=FALSE}
plot_list <- lapply(
  account_info, 
  plot_km,
  surv_data = cleaned_data, 
  risk_table = F
)
account_info_plot <- arrange_ggsurvplots(
  x = plot_list, 
  ncol = 2, nrow = 2,
  print = F
)
ggsave(
  filename = "./imgs/account_info_plot.jpg",
  plot = account_info_plot, 
  height = 8, width = 12
)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:kmcustaccount) enriches the $\chi^2$ tests' results as it draws survival curves for each treatment variable's categories. When the firm/client contract is type month-to-month, the estimated survivor function decreases far more than for one-year or two-year contracts. In other words, the churn hazard is higher when the contract is renewed each month. This result makes sense as the customer may decide to leave the *portfolio* once the month has ended as they are not commited for one or two years. Furthermore, clients with paperless billing contracts are more prone to churn, just like those paying by electronic check. It can be deduce that the *attrition* risk is higher when the payment method is simplified. 

```{r kmcustaccount, fig.cap="Kaplan-Meier survival function depending on customer account information"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./imgs/account_info_plot.jpg")
```

## Churn, duration and price

The final step in the data exploration consists in analysing the relationship between the `Monthly_Charges`, `Churn_Label` and `Tenure_Months` variables as they play an important role in the modelling strategy we adopt to estimate customer *value*.

Looking at figure \@ref(fig:cltvchurn), monthly charges seem to be higher for churners than for retained customers as the density is more right-oriented. High fees might be a driver of customer churn. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
monthly_charges_churn_plot <- dens_plot(
  data=cleaned_data, 
  treatment = "Churn_Label", 
  target = "Monthly_Charges",
  base_size = 12
) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Churn"),
         color=guide_legend(title="Churn"))

ggsave(
  filename = "./imgs/monthly_charges_churn_plot.jpg", 
  plot = monthly_charges_churn_plot, 
  height = 4, width = 6
)
```


```{r cltvchurn, fig.cap="Monthly charges paid by customers depending on churn status", out.height="300pt", out.width="400pt"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./imgs/monthly_charges_churn_plot.jpg")
```

Besides, the low *p value* related to the Anova test between `CLTV` and `Churn_Label` indicates that customer lifetime value is statistically different between churner and retained clients.

```{r aovcltvchurn}
aov_test_tab(
  data = cleaned_data, 
  target = "Monthly_Charges", 
  treatment = "Churn_Label"
) %>%
  mykable(title = "Anova test between monthly fees and churn status")
```


```{r}
n_bins <- unique(cleaned_data$Tenure_Months) %>% 
  length()
duration_churn_plot <- cleaned_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Tenure_Months,
    fill = Churn_Label
  )) +
  geom_histogram(bins = n_bins, alpha = .4) +
  labs(x = "Tenure months", y = "Count") +
  scale_color_jco() +
  scale_fill_jco() +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Churn"),
         color=guide_legend(title="Churn")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 11), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10))

ggsave(
  filename = "./imgs/duration_churn_plot.jpg", 
  plot = duration_churn_plot, 
  height = 4, width = 6
)
```

The following histograms are interesting to the extent that the distribution of `Tenure_Months` depends on the churn status. From figure \@ref(fig:churndur), one can note an inflation of low and high values for retained customers. The distribution appears to be more homogeneous for retained clients than for churners. These lasts' tenure months distribution is decreasing and looks like a Poisson distribution with an inflation of low values. 

```{r churndur, fig.cap="Tenure months depending on churn status", out.height="350pt", out.width="500pt"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./imgs/duration_churn_plot.jpg")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
monthly_charges_dur <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(Tenure_Months) %>%
  summarise(avg_monthly_charges = mean(Monthly_Charges)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Tenure_Months, 
             y = avg_monthly_charges)) +
    geom_point(alpha = .5) +
    geom_smooth(size = .6) +
  labs(x = "Number of months", 
       y = "Average monthly fees") 

ggsave(
  filename = "./imgs/monthly_charges_dur.jpg", 
  plot = monthly_charges_dur, 
  height = 4, width = 6
)
```

Eventually, figure \@ref(fig:monthlychargesdur) depicts the average monthly charges per number of months in the portfolio. One can notice an increasing evolution between the average monthly fees and the number of months. In other words, it might be assumed that customers with longer lifetimes bring in more money to the firm. 

```{r monthlychargesdur, fig.cap="Average monthly fees depending on number of months in the portfolio", out.height="300pt", out.width="450pt"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./imgs/monthly_charges_dur.jpg")
```
