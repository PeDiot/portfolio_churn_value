This [bookdown](https://pediot.github.io/portfolio_churn_value/) is being realized as part of our last year in master's degree in economics. It aims at studying a firm's most valuable asset namely its customers. To that end, we adopt a quantitative approach based on econometrics and data analysis with a threefold purpose to : 

- model a *customer portfolio* as a set of customer segments; 
- predict and analyse customer *churn*; 
- estimate a customer portfolio's overall *value*.

After having defined the subject's key concepts, we apply duration models and machine learning techniques to a [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset) dataset related to customers of a fictional telecommunications service provider (TSP).
