# Portfolio, Attrition and Customer Value

This paper is being realized as part of our last year in master's degree in Economics. It aims at studying the firm's most valuable asset: its customers. To that end, we adopt a quantitative approach based on a mix of Econometrics and Data Science techniques with a threefold purpose:

- Model customer *portfolio* as a set of customer segments.
- Predict and analyse customer *attrition*.
- Estimate the overall *value* of the firm's portfolio.

After having defined the subject's key concepts, we apply unsupervised classification algorithms and duration models to a [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset) dataset related to customers of a fictional telecommunications service provider (TSP). Once the customer segments identified and customer lifetime estimated, a new metric is proposed to compute customer *value* during their lifetime in the portfolio. The *value* of the portfolio is then calculated and various simulations are realised.
