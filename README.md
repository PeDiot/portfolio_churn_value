This paper is being realized as part of our last year in master's degree in economics. It aims at studying the firm's most valuable asset: its customers. To that end, we adopt a quantitative approach based on a mix of Econometrics and Data Science techniques with a threefold purpose:

- Model *customer portfolio* as a set of customer segments; 
- Predict and analyze customer *churn*; 
- Estimate customer portfolio's overall *value*.

<<<<<<< HEAD
After having defined the subject's key concepts, we apply duration models and machine learning algorithms to a [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset) dataset related to customers of a fictional telecommunications service provider (TSP).

***Keywords***: *customer portfolio management (CPM), churn, customer value, duration models, machine learning, telecom.* 

The book can be viewed [here]()https://pediot.github.io/portfolio_churn_value/). It can also be downloaded to pdf file even though some issues can be noted in image display.
