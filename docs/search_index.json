It aims at studying a firms most valuable asset namely its customers. To that end, we adopt a quantitative approach based on econometrics and data analysis with a threefold purpose to : model a customer portfolio as a set of customer segments; predict and analyse customer churn; estimate a customer portfolios overall value. After having defined the subjects key concepts, we apply duration models and machine learning techniques to a kaggle dataset related to customers of a fictional telecommunications service provider (TSP).

The notion of portfolio has greatly evolved before a firms consumer base was considered as a set of portfolios. In chapter 3 a part of the literature review depicts an evolution of the portfolio management notion. A customer portfolio can be defined as a set of customers divided into several segments (or clusters) based on similar attributes. These discriminant features can be both economic - willingness to pay, budget constraint, etc. - and sociological - gender, age, socio-professional category, etc. . The underlying objective of this segmentation is to optimally allocate the companys resources. When dealing with customer portfolio management (CPM), two dimensions can be considered. On the one hand, it can be assumed that a customer stays in the same segment throughout their life in the firms portfolio. On the other hand, a dynamic approach can be adopted as suggested by Homburg on dynamics in customer portfolios (Homburg, Steiner, and Totzek 2009). In their article, the authors question the static analysis by assuming that a customer can switch between segments. They explain that one of the firms objectives is to convert less valuable customers into more valuable ones. In this context, customers can also be segmented depending on their value to the firm and their cost to serve (Thakur and Workmanb 2016), as depicted by figure 2.1. Figure 2.1: CPM Matrix 2.2 What is attrition? Customer attrition or churn occurs when a client discontinues using a service or a product offered by a firm. Churn analysis corresponds to measuring the attrition rate in the customer base of any company. However, evaluating attrition depends on the type of relationship between the firm and its clients. When it is defined by a contract, the customer has to inform the firm about their service termination. In the telecom industry, a consumer is required to notify their telecommunications service provider (TSP) before going to a competing company. In an opposite way, the firm/client relationship can be non-contractual. In that case, the service termination does not need to be notified. Attrition then becomes a latent variable and more advanced models are used to make forecasts. 2.3 What does customer value mean? In customer portfolio management, one clients value is represented by the customer lifetime value (CLV). CLV is the present value of all future purchases made by a customer over their lifetime in the firms portfolio, taking into account the attrition risk. CLV depends both on the purchase recency as well as on the purchasing rate and aims at identifying the most valuable customer groups. Formally, Gupta and Lehmann (Gupta and Lehmann 2003) define CLV for customer \\(i\\) as follows: \\[CLV_i = \\sum_{t=0}^{T_i} \\frac{(p_t - c_t)r_{i,t}}{(1+a)^t} - AC_i\\] with, \\(p_t\\) the price paid by customer \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\) \\(c_t\\) the cost at time \\(t\\) \\(r_{i,t}\\) the probability that customer \\(i\\) be active at time \\(t\\) \\(a\\) the discount rate \\(AC_i\\) the acquisition cost of customer \\(i\\) \\(T_i\\) the duration of observation An estimation of the portfolios overall value can be calculated through customer equity (CE) which amounts to the sum of all the CLVs. Since CE appears to be a good proxy of the firms value, the profit maximization program can be rewritten as: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\max_{p} \\quad &amp; \\textrm{CE} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{t=0}^{T_i} \\frac{(p_t - c_t)r_{i,t}}{(1+a)^t} - AC_i\\\\ \\textrm{s.t.} \\quad &amp; r_{i,t} \\in [0, 1]\\\\ &amp;p_t &gt; c_t \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] References "],["literature.html", "Chapter 3 Literature Review 3.1 On customer portfolio 3.2 On attrition 3.3 On customer value", " Chapter 3 Literature Review 3.1 On customer portfolio 3.2 On attrition 3.3 On customer value In recent years, customer portfolio management (CPM) has focused on optimizing clients value to the firm. The companys interest lies in knowing how much net benefit it can expect from a customer today. These expectations are then used to implement efficient marketing strategies to get the highest return on investment. To that end, two key metrics are estimated by firms, namely customer lifetime value (CLV) and customer equity (CE) (see chapter 2 for definitions). According to Blattberg and Deighton, CLV can be defined as the revenues derived from a customer minus the cost to the firm for maintaining the relationship with the customer over time (Blattberg and Deighton 1996). As shown by Reinartz and Kumar, CLV modelling depends on the type of relationship a firm has with its clients (Reinartz and Kumar. 2003). In a contractual relationship, customer defections are observed which means that longer lifetime means higher customer value. Conversely, when the relationship is non-contractual, uncertainty arises between the customers purchase behavior and lifetime. With the development of data collection tools, companies have lots of customer-level data (or customer transaction data) at their disposal to measure CLV (Fader and al. 2005). Consequently, different modelling approaches can be adopted in order to estimate customers value. RFM (Recency Frequency Monetary) models are considered the simplest strategy to increase CLV and customers loyalty (Gupta, Hanssens, and Hardie 2006). It aims at targeting specific marketing campaigns at specific groups of customers to improve response rates. RFM models consists in creating clusters of clients based on three variables: recency which is the time that has elapsed since a customers last activity with the firm; frequency that is the number of times a customer transacted with the brand in a particular period of time; monetary value of customers prior purchases. However, RFM models have a limited predictive power since they only predict clients behavior for the next period. In their article on CLV management, Borle and Singh draw the review of more advanced modelling techniques that can be implemented to estimate customers value (Borle and Singh 2008). A popular method to estimate customer lifetime value is the negative binomial distribution (NBD) - Pareto (Fader and al. 2005) which helps solving the lifetime uncertainty issue. The model takes past customer purchase behavior as input such as the number of purchases in a specific time window and the date of last transaction. Then the model outputs a repurchase probability as well as a transaction forecast for each individual. In Borle and Singhs research paper, a hierarchical bayesian model is implemented with a view to jointly predict customers churn risk and spending pattern. Here, the main advantage of using a bayesian approach is to give priors on CLVs drivers. The study is base on data coming from a membership-based direct marketing company where firm/client relationships are non-contractual. In other words, the times of each customer joining the membership and terminating it are known once these events happen. Thus the implementation of a sophisticated estimation strategy is justified. In our study, emphasize is placed on estimating the overall value of a customer portfolio. The methodology we will develop is based on a research paper written by our Econometrics teacher Alain Bousquet, whose goal is provide tools for an efficient management of a patent portfolio (Bousquet 2021). The main idea is to consider each patent as an asset with a related value which can generate income if this very patent is exploited. This modelling approach can be transposed to customer portfolio analysis with the customers value corresponding to the CLV and the probability of exploitation being the opposite of the risk of attrition. In this context, CLV can be estimated with techniques mentioned above. The clients risk of churn can be modelled with duration models or machine learning techniques as evoked in 3.2. References "],["framework.html", "Chapter 4 Theoretical Framework 4.1 Duration models 4.2 Machine Learning techniques", " Chapter 4 Theoretical Framework This chapter presents theoretical basis of the models and the algorithms that we will use to model customer portfolios. As a customers lifetime in a portfolio is usually represented by the time to churn, duration models are adapted to the data we have at our disposal. Thus, it is decided to introduce standard survival techniques as well as machine learning algorithms suited to time-to-event data. Methods to estimate customers value are also introduced in this chapter. 4.1 Duration models According to Cameron &amp; Trivedi (Cameron and Trivedi 2005), duration models (also called survival models) aims at measuring the time spent in a certain state before transitioning to another state. In Econometrics, a state corresponds to the class in which an individual \\(i\\) is at time \\(t\\). a transition is movement from one state to another. a duration measures the time spent in a certain state and is also called a spell length. Since measuring the time until the event is needed for multiple purposes, duration analysis is used in a variety of economic sectors as depicted by the following table. Economic sector Purpose Macroeconomics Length of an unemployment spell Insurance Risk analysis to offer a segmented pricing Engineering Time until a device breaks down Epidemiology Survival time of a virus Churn analysis Time until a customer leave the portfolio 4.1.1 Censoring and Truncation When dealing with survival data, some observations are usually censored meaning they are related to spells which are not completely observed. Duration data can also suffer from a selection bias which is called truncation. Censoring mechanisms Left-censoring occurs when the event of interest occurs before the beginning of the observation period. For example, an individual is included in a study of duration of unemployment at \\(t_0\\). At that time he has already been unemployed for a period but he cannot recall exactly the duration of this period. If we observe that he finds a job again at \\(t_1\\), we can only deduce that the duration of unemployment is bigger than \\(t_1-t_0\\), this individual is left-censored. Observation 2 on figure 4.1 is associated with a left-censored spell (Liu 2019). A spell is considered right-censored when it is observed from time \\(t_0\\) until a censoring time \\(t_c\\) as illustrated by observation 1 on figure 4.1. For instance, the lifetime related to a customer who has not churned at the end of the observation period is right-censored. Let us note \\(X_i\\) the duration of a complete spell and \\(C_i\\) the duration of a right-censored spell. We also note \\(T_i\\) the duration actually observed and \\(\\delta_i\\) the censoring indicator such that \\(\\delta_i = 0\\) if the spell is censored. Then, \\((t_1, \\delta_1),\\dots,(t_N, \\delta_N)\\) are the realizations of the following random variables: \\[ \\begin{align} T_i &amp; = \\min(X_i, C_i) \\\\ \\delta_i &amp; = \\mathbb{1}_{X_i &lt; C_i} \\end{align} \\] Selection bias Survival data suffers from a selection bias (or truncation) when only a sub-sample of the population of interest is studied. A customer entering the firms portfolio after the end of the study is said to be right-truncated, whereas a client who has left the portfolio before the beginning of the study is considered left-truncated. Mathematically, a random variable \\(X\\) is truncated by a subset \\(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^+\\) if instead of \\(\\Omega(X)\\), we solely observe \\(\\Omega(X)\\bigcap A\\). On figure 4.1, the first and fifth observations suffers from a selection bias.
