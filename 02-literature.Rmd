# Literature Review {#literature}

Now the concepts of *portfolio*, *attrition* and *value* have been defined, it seems relevant to take a look at the literature on these notions. The literature review made in this chapter synthesises and analyses the available articles related to customer *portfolio* modelling, *attrition* analysis as well as customer *value* estimation. The review combines concepts from Economics, Econometrics and Data Science. 

## On customer portfolio {#portfolio}

*Portfolio* management methods have been applied to an increasing number of areas over time. This term is originally used in finance by @MARKOWITZ with a view of managing equities. He develops a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk. Markovitz's model is based on diversification which is the idea that owning different kinds of financial assets is less risky than owning only one type. His theory uses the variance of asset prices as a proxy for risk. Later in the 1970-80's, *portfolio* models are incorporated into corporate [@WIND] and marketing [@DAY] strategies for profit-maximization via optimal resource allocation. Then, @CAPON provide insights on efficient management for *portfolios* of technologies and study how well technological means mobilized by a firm are complement. More recently, in the interest of improving relationships between the firm and its clients, the *portfolio* modelling approach have focused on effective customer relationship management (CRM).  The following figure depicts the evolution of *portfolio* analysis through time.

```

In their article @CPM_CRM examine how a company can define the
value of customers and segment these customers into portfolios. They explain how segmentation leads to better understanding of the relative importance of each customer to the company's total profit. The authors consider a *portfolio* segmented into four groups of clients: *platinum*, *gold*, *silver* and *bronze* customers. The *portfolio* segmentation is based both on the cost to serve a client as well as the latter's value to the firm, as depicted by figure \@ref(fig:cpmmat). 

```{r cpmmat, fig.cap="CPM Matrix", out.height="250pt", out.width="250pt"}

```

According to this repartition into four main groups, Thakur and Workman highlight three strategies the firm can launch in order to efficiently manage its *portfolio*. **Retention** aims to induce *platinum* customers into repeating their purchases as they have a large contribution to the firm's revenue. **Customer relationship development** can be used to encourage customers to advance and upgrade to a higher segment. Such a strategy can be efficient for customers with high preference for a certain product or those with potential to shift to higher margin products. Conversely, **customer elimination or filtering** strategies are set up by the firm to encourage bottom customers who cost more than they are worth to leave the **portfolio**.

As said in the introduction, an interesting improvement of portfolio analysis may be to add a temporal dimension to the models. @MANAGING_DYNAMICS_CUSTOMER_PORTFOLIO show that the dynamic approach minimizes the current bias of underestimating low-value clients and overestimating high-value ones.


## On attrition {#attrition}

*Attrition* or churn has become a buzzword these last years. Churn analysis can be seen as an economic problem for three main reasons. Firstly, customers are in some way the firm's more precious asset. Secondly, the firm's resources in terms of customer relationship management are limited, so an efficient allocation needs to be deployed. Thirdly churn being a risk the firm has to cope with, it leads to asymmetric information from the firm's side. With the development of advanced Econometrics and Data Science, several methods can be implemented in order to estimate churn. 

On the one hand, survival models are helpful in measuring customers' lifetime. In her thesis, @SURV_METHODS_INSURANCE applies duration analysis to model the behavior of customers from an insurance company with a threefold purpose: 

- Identify factors influencing customer loyalty. 
- Estimate the remaining lifetime of a client who has purchased multiple policies and cancelled one of them. 
- Study the influence of covariates changing over time.

Her study is motivated by the importance of the insurer/policyholder relationship in a digitalized environment where the costs of searching for information are increasingly lower and the risk of *attrition* consequently higher. The author develops a two-part methodology to address the study's problematic. She begins by solely selecting insureds with at least two policies. Then, she fits a logit model to predict whether a policyholder will cancel their policies at the same time (type 1) or sequentially (type 2). She finally applies duration models on type 2 clients to determine the remaining time until all their policies are cancelled.

On the other hand, machine learning classification algorithms can be used for churn detection as illustrated by the work of @CHURN_INSURANCE. Her objective is to develop a predictive model to detect customer churn in an insurance company while highlighting the key drivers of *attrition*. The underlying goals of her research paper are both minimizing revenue loss caused by churn and boosting the firm's competitiveness. Using data on vehicle insurance policies, Bellani incorporates features on the policyholders, the vehicles, the insurance policies as well as marketing data to predict the churn indicator variable. After missing data imputation and dimensionality reduction, the author falls back on under-sampling to overcome the issue of unbalanced classes. There are indeed much more active than cancelled policies in the dataset. Her methodology works as follows: 

- The set of active policies is divided into 7 groups equal in size to the number of cancelled policies.
- For each group of active policies, classification models (logistic regression, random forest and neural network) are trained on a subset including all the cancelled policies as well as the concerned group of active ones. 
- For each model, the predictions are aggregated across the 7 subsets for the final prediction.
- Model selection is made by the means of the Kappa performance metric.


Ultimately when a customer leaves the firm's portfolio, it may worth it to consider all possible outcomes for the reason he churned. For instance, a client might leave their telecom company because of a bad service quality, or because of too high a price. In this context, competing risk analysis can be introduced since its main interest is to determine the reason why the client churned. In their recent article, @COMPETING_RISKS try to predict both the likelihood of customer churn and the reasons for churn using customer service data from a Dutch TSP. They estimate duration and competing risk models. In the competing risk model, three possible output states are considered: Controllable risk, Uncontrollable risk and Unknown risk. Each type of risk is assumed independent from another which means a client cannot be at high risk for two risks simultaneously. Besides, the authors implement a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (see @LDA for more details) to identify the main topics in a set of emails sent by customers to the service center. Six topics are discovered by the algorithm and each of them is then incorporated as explanatory variable into the models. These topic variables increase the performance of both competing risk models for Controllable and Unknown risks and standard duration models. According to Slof, Frasincar, and Matsiiako, *"customers who churn due to the Controllable risk or due to the Unknown risk tend to call the customer service center with a specific problem, while customers who churn due to the Uncontrollable risk do not call the customer service center with a specific problem"*. 

## On customer value {#value}

In recent years, customer *portfolio* management (CPM) has focused on optimizing clients' *value* to the firm. The company's interest lies in knowing how much net benefit it can expect from a customer today. These expectations are then used to implement efficient marketing strategies to get the highest return on investment. To that end, two key metrics are estimated by firms: customer lifetime value (CLV) and customer equity (CE) (see part \@ref(valuedef) in the introduction for definitions).

According to @CLV_DEF, CLV is atemporal variable defined as the revenue derived from a customer minus the cost to the firm for maintaining the relationship with this very customer. As shown by @CLV_CONTEXT, CLV modelling depends on the type of relationship a firm has with its clients. In a contractual relationship, customer defections are observed which means that longer lifetime means higher customer value. Conversely, when the relationship is non-contractual, uncertainty arises between the customer's purchase behavior and lifetime.

With the development of data collection tools, companies have lots of customer-level data (or customer transaction data) at their disposal to measure CLV [@CLV_NBD]. Consequently, different modelling approaches can be adopted in order to estimate customer *value.*

Recency Frequency Monetary (RFM) models are considered the simplest strategy to measure CLV and customer loyalty [@CLV]. It aims at targeting specific marketing campaigns at specific groups of customers to improve response rates. RFM models consists in creating clusters of clients based on three variables: 

- *Recency* which is the time that has elapsed since a customer’s last activity with the firm.
- *Frequency* that is the number of times a customer transacted with the brand in a particular period of time.
- *Monetary* that is to say the value of customer's prior purchases. 

However, RFM models have a limited predictive power since they only predict clients' behavior for the next period. 

In their article on CLV management, @CLV_MEASUREMENT draw the review of more advanced modelling techniques that can be implemented to estimate customers' *value.* A popular method to estimate customer lifetime value is the negative binomial distribution (NBD) - Pareto [@CLV_NBD] which helps solving the lifetime uncertainty issue. The model takes past customer purchase behavior as input such as the number of purchases in a specific time window and the date of last transaction. Then the model outputs a repurchase probability as well as a transaction forecast for each individual. In Borle and Singh's research paper, a hierarchical bayesian model is implemented with a view to jointly predict customer's churn risk and spending pattern. Here, the main advantage of using a bayesian approach is to give priors on CLV's drivers. The study is based on data coming from a membership-based direct marketing company where firm/client relationships are non-contractual. In other words, the times of each customer joining the membership and terminating it are known once these events happen. Thus the implementation of a sophisticated estimation strategy is justified. 

In our study, emphasize is placed on estimating the overall value of a customer portfolio. The methodology we will develop is based on a research paper written by our Econometrics teacher Alain Bousquet, whose goal is to provide tools for an efficient management of patent *portfolios* [@BREVETS]. The main idea is to consider each patent as an asset with a related value which can generate income if this very patent is exploited. The author emphasizes the importance to focus on the *portfolio*'s **variance** on top of its expected value. Specifically, he explains that the variability in the probability of success in the exploitation of patents leads to a decrease in the overall risk to which the *portfolio* is exposed.  This modelling approach can be transposed to customer *portfolio* analysis with the customer's *value* corresponding to the CLV and the probability of exploitation being the opposite of the risk of *attrition*. In this context, CLV can be estimated either with techniques mentioned above or regression methods. The customer's risk of churn can be modelled with duration models or machine learning techniques as evoked in \@ref(attrition). With this econometric framework, it is expected that customer heterogeneity be a key factor in the total variance of the portfolio's *value*.
